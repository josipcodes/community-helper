## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Below pages were validated through a manual input as they required user to be logged in. Code was obtained by selecting **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).

As such, W3C links are purely informational.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

All errors are coming from Bootstrap:

Browsers used:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)

## Bugs

- Contents of a comment remain in the form after it has been published.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/43)
    
    - To fix this, I have added an empty `form` into the `context`, however, this fix was refactored later on.

- `Pagination` is displayed over content.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/37)

    - To fix this, I have removed `fixed-bottom class` from the pagination `div`.

- `Footer` covers content on <=575px width.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/33)

    - To fix this, I have added `footer margin` using `CSS`.

- Styling changes when user is logged in or logged out.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/29)

    - To fix this, I have created a class `task-link` and associted it with existing CSS rule regarding link display.

- Navbar links change position when user is logged in or logged out.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/28)

    - To fix this, I have removed `me-auto class` from the affected `ul`.

- Overflow x when user opens the dropdown menu.

[Documented bug](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/22)
[Related user story](https://github.com/josipcodes/community-helper/issues/21)

    - To present a true Agile approach, this bug was prioritised due to existence of a user story which presented a type of fix. As such, we have included a template which confirms user's username when logged in, depending on their screen size.

```
    {% include "login_confirm.html" %}

    <span class="brand-color">
        Logged in as {{ user.username }}
    </span>
```
